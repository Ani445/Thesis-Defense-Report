\begin{abstract}
Semantic segmentation is a key task in computer vision that involves interpreting images at the pixel level. While fully supervised methods provide high accuracy, they require extensive pixel-level annotations, making them resource-intensive. Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) addresses this issue by using weaker supervision formats like image-level labels, reducing the need for annotation while still training effective segmentation models.

Recent WSSS advancements have shown that competitive performance can be reached with minimal labeled data through the use of Class Activation Maps (CAMs). However, challenges such as sparsity and inadequate boundary delineation affect CAM quality.

This study aims to improve CAM quality by exploring effective backbone architectures and refinement strategies. We investigate multi-modal architectures like UniCL and hierarchical transformers such as Swin Transformer to enhance feature extraction. To further refine CAMs, we use an affinity-based framework that combines decoder-derived affinities with attention maps, creating more semantically coherent pseudo-labels. Additionally, we incorporate a Pixel-Adaptive Refinement (PAR) module to refine pseudo-labels based on local similarities, ensuring better object boundaries.

Our experiments demonstrate that UniCL and Swin Transformer can localize objects more effectively and precisely, thus generating better CAMs than than traditional transformers.
