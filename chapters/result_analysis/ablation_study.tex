\section{Ablation Study}
\label{sec:ablation_study}

To evaluate the contribution of the Refinement Module (RFM) in our UniCL-AffSeg framework, we conducted an ablation study comparing the segmentation performance with and without the RFM. This analysis allows us to quantify how the RFM improves the initial Class Activation Maps (CAMs) generated by the Swin Transformer backbone.

\subsection{Analysis}

\autoref{tab:ablation_rfm_comparison} shows the per-class IoU and overall mean IoU (mIoU) for the Pascal VOC dataset, comparing the baseline model without RFM against the model with RFM applied. Several observations can be made:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The inclusion of the RFM improves the overall mIoU from 0.469 to 0.503, demonstrating a clear benefit in segmentation quality.
    \item Classes that are large or visually distinctive, such as \textit{bus}, \textit{cat}, \textit{dog}, and \textit{sheep}, show noticeable improvements in IoU.
    \item Small or complex objects like \textit{bicycle}, \textit{diningtable}, and \textit{sofa} also benefit from RFM, indicating that the module helps refine boundaries and capture finer details.
    \item Interestingly, the \textit{person} class shows a slight decrease. This reflects dataset bias in the UniCL pretraining datasets, where the model has limited exposure to humans, making RFM refinement less effective in this particular case.
\end{itemize}

Overall, the ablation study confirms that the RFM effectively enhances segmentation quality by refining initial CAMs using affinity information and contextual cues, particularly for classes that are underrepresented or have complex shapes. These results establish a strong baseline for subsequent experiments and highlight the importance of the RFM in improving both boundary delineation and class-specific performance.
