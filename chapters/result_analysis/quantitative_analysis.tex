\section{Quantitative Analysis}
\label{sec:quantitative_analysis}

We evaluated the performance of our proposed method on the PASCAL VOC 2012 \textbf{validation} and \textbf{test} sets using standard metrics: \textbf{mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)}, \textbf{pixel accuracy (pAcc)}, and \textbf{mean accuracy (mAcc)}. The results are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:summarized_results}. 

On the \textbf{validation set}, our method achieves a \textbf{mean IoU of 50.3\%}, a pixel accuracy of 80.1\%, and a mean accuracy of 69.99\%.  
On the \textbf{test set}, the model achieves a slightly higher \textbf{mean IoU of 50.8\%}, with a pixel accuracy of 79.6\% and mean accuracy of 71.36\%.  

These results indicate that the model generalizes well across both validation and test sets, consistently segmenting dominant classes effectively. In particular, the strong performance on large and distinctive categories such as \textbf{background}, \textbf{bus}, \textbf{sheep}, and \textbf{cow} highlights the model's ability to capture prominent visual structures. However, performance remains weaker on small or less frequent categories such as \textbf{person}, \textbf{chair}, and \textbf{bicycle}, suggesting that future improvements should focus on enhancing recognition of rare and small objects.
