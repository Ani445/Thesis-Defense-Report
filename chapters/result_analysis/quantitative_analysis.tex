\label{sec:quantitative_analysis}

We evaluated the performance of our proposed method on the PASCAL VOC 2012 validation set using standard metrics: \textbf{mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)}, \textbf{pixel accuracy (pAcc)}, and \textbf{mean accuracy (mAcc)}. The results are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:quantitative_results}. 

Our method achieves a \textbf{mean IoU of 50.0\%}, a pixel accuracy of 79.8\%, and a mean accuracy of 69.97\%. These results indicate that the model segments dominant classes effectively, outperforming many single-stage weakly supervised approaches.

% \subsection{Per-Class Analysis}

% Table~\ref{tab:per_class_iou} presents the per-class IoU scores. The performance varies significantly across different classes. Large and well-represented classes such as \textbf{background} (77.8\%), \textbf{bus} (67.5\%), \textbf{cat} (65.9\%), and \textbf{dog} (65.1\%) are segmented effectively. In contrast, smaller or less frequent classes such as \textbf{person} (16.9\%), \textbf{chair} (25.3\%), and \textbf{potted plant} (28.3\%) remain challenging.

% This discrepancy highlights the model's tendency to perform better on classes with larger spatial extent and more training samples, while struggling with rare or small objects.
