\section{Data and Experimental Setup}
\label{subsec:data_and_experimental_setup}

We conducted our experiments on the \textbf{Pascal VOC 2012} dataset \cite{dataset_pascal_voc}, 
which contains 20 object categories and one background class. 
The dataset is split into 1,464 training images, 1,449 validation images, 
and 1,456 test images. Since the test set does not provide ground truth 
annotations, we used the training set for model training and the validation 
set for performance evaluation.

All experiments were implemented in the \textbf{PyTorch} framework and executed 
on a single \textbf{NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU} with \textbf{16 GB of memory}, 
provided by Google Colab (free tier). During training, images were randomly 
resized within the range of 512--2048 pixels, rescaled by factors between 
0.5 and 2.0, and cropped to a fixed size of 224.

Optimization was performed using the \textbf{AdamW} optimizer with a learning 
rate of $5 \times 10^{-5}$, $\beta_1 = 0.9$, $\beta_2 = 0.999$, and a weight 
decay of 0.01. We trained the models for \textbf{30,000 iterations} with an 
effective batch size of 8 (per-GPU batch size of 4 with gradient accumulation 
steps of 2). A linear warmup strategy was applied during the first 500 iterations 
with a warmup ratio of $10^{-3}$. The best-performing checkpoints were selected 
based on validation set performance.
