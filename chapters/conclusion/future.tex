\section*{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

So far, we have only studied different models, architectures and methods for refining CAMs,pseudo-labels and segmentation maps. But we have not yet performed enough experiments to find any better approach to generate better CAMs. And the few that we have done showed very poor results. So, we have to do more experiments to find better backbones/approaches to generate better CAMs. We can also try to find better methods to refine the CAMs and pseudo-labels and segmentation maps.

Here is list of things we can do in the future:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use different backbones and architectures to generate better CAMs.
    \item Look for better methods to aggregate the feature maps and attention maps from the intermediate layers of the backbones.
    \item Use different methods to refine the CAMs and pseudo-labels.
    \item Use different models (so far only SegFormer \cite{fsss_segformer} has been used) to generate better segmentation maps.
    \item Use different methods to refine the segmentation maps.
    \item Look for any other objective functions that can be used to train the models.
    \item 
\end{itemize}

These directions provide a roadmap for future exploration and improvement in our work.
