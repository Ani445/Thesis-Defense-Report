\section{Fully Supervised Semantic Segmentation}
\label{sec:fully-supervised}

In fully supervised semantic segmentation, the model is trained on a dataset with pixel-level annotations. The model learns to predict the class of each pixel in an image based on the provided annotations. This approach typically requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain.

\subsection{Early Approaches}
\label{subsec:early-approaches}
The early approaches to semantic segmentation relied heavily on hand-crafted features and traditional machine learning techniques. These methods often involved extracting low-level features such as color, texture, and shape from the images and then using classifiers like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) or Random Forests to assign labels to each pixel.

Then came the era of deep learning, where convolutional neural networks (CNNs) revolutionized the field. The introduction of fully convolutional networks (FCNs) allowed for end-to-end training of segmentation models, enabling them to learn spatial hierarchies of features directly from the data. This was a significant breakthrough, as it eliminated the need for manual feature extraction and allowed for more accurate and efficient segmentation.

\subsection{Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)}
\label{subsec:cnn_sem_seg}

The first fully convolutional network (FCN) for semantic segmentation was proposed by \cite{fsss_fcn}, which replaced the fully connected layers in traditional CNNs with convolutional layers. This allowed the network to produce dense predictions for each pixel in the input image. The FCN architecture was further improved by adding skip connections, which helped to preserve spatial information and improve segmentation accuracy.

Then came the introduction of U-Net \cite{fsss_unet}, a popular architecture for semantic segmentation that is widely used in medical imaging and other applications. U-Net consists of an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder captures context information and the decoder enables precise localization. The \emph{skip connections} between the encoder and decoder blocks play a crucial role by retaining spatial information, making U-Net particularly effective for tasks with limited training data.

The field of semantic segmentation has continued to evolve, with the introduction of various architectures and techniques.

The deeplab series \cite{fsss_deeplabv1, fsss_deeplabv2, fsss_deeplabv3,fsss_deeplabv3plus} introduced atrous convolution and spatial pyramid pooling to capture multi-scale context information; \cite{fsss_deeplabv1} also used a methd called CRF (Conditional Random Field) to refine the segmentation results. But it was removed in the later versions of the model. In \cite{fsss_deeplabv2}, the atrous convolution method evolved into a more general form called atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP), which allows the model to capture features at multiple scales. The ASPP module consists of parallel atrous convolutions with different rates, enabling the model to learn multi-scale context information effectively. Finally \cite{fsss_deeplabv3plus} introduced a new decoder module that refines the segmentation results by combining low-level features from the encoder with high-level features from the ASPP module. This approach improves the localization of object boundaries and enhances the overall segmentation performance.

\cite{fsss_pspnet} introduced the Pyramid Scene Parsing Network (PSPNet), which uses a pyramid pooling module to capture global context information at different scales. The pyramid pooling module aggregates features from different regions of the image, allowing the model to learn rich contextual information for better segmentation.

\cite{fsss_segnet} proposed SegNet, an encoder-decoder architecture that focuses on efficient upsampling of feature maps. SegNet uses a series of convolutional and pooling layers in the encoder to extract features, followed by a corresponding decoder that upsamples the feature maps to produce the final segmentation output. The main innovation in SegNet is the use of unpooling layers, which store the indices of the max-pooling operation during encoding, instead of the feature maps themselves. This allows for more efficient memory usage and faster inference times, making SegNet suitable for real-time applications.

\subsection{Transformers}
\label{subsec:transformers}
The introduction of transformers in computer vision has led to significant advancements in semantic segmentation. Vision Transformer (ViT) \cite{transformer_vit} and its variants have shown promising results in various tasks, including semantic segmentation. ViTs leverage self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies and global context information, making them suitable for dense prediction tasks.
The years later on, the transformer-based architectures have gained popularity in semantic segmentation. \cite{transformer_swin} proposed the Swin Transformer, which introduces a hierarchical architecture with shifted windows to capture both local and global context information. The Swin Transformer has shown state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark datasets, including ImageNet-1k \cite{dataset_imagenet} for image classification and COCO \cite{dataset_coco} for object detection and \cite{dataset_ade20k} for semantic segmentation. The Swin Transformer has been widely adopted in various applications.

Leveraging the strengths of Vision Transformer, \cite{fsss_setr} first proposed the SETR (Semantic Segmentation Transformer) architecture, which replaces the traditional CNN backbone with a transformer encoder. The SETR architecture consists of a ViT encoder that processes the input image and generates a set of feature maps, followed by a decoder that upsamples the feature maps to produce the final segmentation output. The SETR model has shown competitive performance on various benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of transformers in semantic segmentation tasks.

\cite{fsss_segmenter} proposed the Segmenter architecture, which combines a ViT backbone with a lightweight decoder for efficient semantic segmentation. The Segmenter model uses a transformer encoder to capture global context information and a simple decoder to produce the final segmentation output. The Segmenter architecture is designed to be computationally efficient while maintaining high accuracy, making it suitable for real-time applications.

\cite{fsss_segformer} introduced SegFormer, a transformer-based architecture that combines the strengths of both CNNs and transformers for semantic segmentation. SegFormer uses a hierarchical transformer encoder to capture multi-scale features and a lightweight decoder to produce the final segmentation output. The SegFormer model has shown state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining CNNs and transformers in semantic segmentation tasks.

The field of semantic segmentation has seen significant advancements with the introduction of various architectures and techniques. The combination of CNNs and transformers has led to improved performance and efficiency in semantic segmentation tasks. As the field continues to evolve, we can expect further innovations and breakthroughs in this area.

\subsection{Problem with Fully Supervised Semantic Segmentation}
\label{subsec:problem-with-fully-supervised}
Fully supervised semantic segmentation has achieved remarkable success, largely driven by powerful models and richly annotated datasets. However, this success comes at a significant cost: acquiring dense pixel-level annotations is both expensive and time-consuming. Each image must be meticulously labeled, often requiring expert knowledge and hours of manual effort. This high annotation burden severely limits the scalability of fully supervised methods, especially for large or specialized datasets. To overcome this bottleneck, the research community has increasingly turned toward weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) â€” an approach that seeks to train effective segmentation models with minimal supervision.

\subsection{Refinement}
\label{subsec:refinement}
A major challenge in weakly supervised semantic segmentation is the generation of high-quality pseudo labels from weak annotations. The quality of these pseudo labels directly impacts the performance of the segmentation model. Therefore, refinement techniques are often employed to improve the quality of the pseudo labels. These techniques can include post-processing methods, such as conditional random fields (CRFs), or affinity based methods that leverage the relationships between pixels to refine the segmentation results.

AffinityNet \cite{wsss_affinitynet} is a notable example of a refinement technique that uses affinity information to improve the segmentation results. After generating initial CAMs from image-level labels, AffinityNet trains a CNN network to classify whether two adjacent pixels belong to the same semantic region. A random walk algorithm, using these affinities, then propagates object labels across the image, enhancing coherence of the segmentation masks.

AFA \cite{wsss_afa_affinity_from_attention} advanced this idea by showing that pixel affinities can be efficiently derived from attention maps of vision transformers, rather than training a separate affinity prediction network. Specifically, AFA extracts affinity information from the self-attention layers of the transformer backbone, using which it performs random walk propagation like AffinityNet. This approach simplifies the refinement pipeline and benefits from the strong semantic relationships already captured by attention mechanisms. In addition, it introduces the Pixel Adaptive Refinement (PAR) module, which uses local color and spatial information to further refine the initial pseudolabels. PAR is based on pixel adaptive convolution and less costly compared to DCRFs. It also dilates the kernels to cover a larger area, allowing it to capture more contextual information.

CLIP-ES \cite{wsss_clip_es} uses a similar approach, but instead of using the attention maps from the transformer, it uses the attention maps from the CLIP model. The CLIP model is a powerful vision-language model that has been shown to be effective in object detection and segmentation tasks. By leveraging the attention maps from the CLIP model, CLIP-ES is able to generate high-quality pseudo labels that are more accurate and robust than those generated by traditional methods. It uses the random walk propagation like AFA, along with a bounding box mask to mask certain affinities while covering more object regions.

Frozen CLIP \cite{wsss_frozen_clip} is another technique that uses the CLIP model to generate pseudo labels. In addition to using the attention maps from the CLIP model, it uses the decoder to generate pseudo labels. Since its backbone is frozen, it requires a decoder to enable the model to learn the affinities of the features. Then it weights the decoder affinities with the frozen CLIP attention maps to get the final affinity map. After that, it uses the random walk propagation with box mask like CLIP-ES and applies the PAR module of AFA to get the final segmentation pseudo labels.

\section{Some other background information}
\label{subsec:some-other-background-information}

\subsection{Multi-Modal Learning}
\label{subsec:multi_modal_learning}
Multi-modal learning involves integrating information from different modalities, such as images and text, to enhance model performance. By combining complementary cues from multiple sources, models can develop a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the data. For instance, in classification tasks, leveraging both visual and textual data enables the model to capture more nuanced semantic relationships. A key advantage of this approach is the potential for zero-shot learning, where the model can recognize and classify images from previously unseen categories. This is accomplished by aligning visual features with corresponding textual descriptions, allowing the model to generalize beyond the training set. Such capabilities are particularly valuable, as classification often underpins many downstream applications.

\subsubsection{Contrastive Learning}
\label{subsec:contrastive_learning}
Contrastive learning is a self-supervised approach focused on learning representations by distinguishing between positive and negative pairs. The objective is to bring representations of related inputs (such as an image and its corresponding textual description) closer in a shared embedding space, while pushing apart representations of unrelated inputs. This is typically achieved using a contrastive loss function, which minimizes the distance between positive pairs and maximizes it for negative pairs. Such a strategy enables models to acquire robust, discriminative, and generalizable feature representations.

\subsubsection{Training Strategy}
\label{subsec:training_strategy}
The training strategy for multi-modal learning generally integrates both supervised and self-supervised techniques. Models are trained on large-scale datasets containing paired samples from different modalities, facilitating the learning of meaningful representations through methods such as contrastive learning. Data augmentation is commonly applied to enhance the diversity and robustness of the learned features, thereby improving the model's generalization to unseen data.

\subsubsection{Task-Agnostic Learning}
\label{subsec:task_agnostic_learning}
Task-agnostic learning refers to the development of representations that are not specialized for a single task but are applicable across a range of downstream applications. This is accomplished by focusing on learning generalizable features through training on diverse datasets and leveraging multi-modal information. As a result, models can adapt their learned representations to various tasks, including image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. This adaptability makes task-agnostic learning a valuable approach for constructing versatile and reusable models.

\subsection{Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP)}
\label{subsec:clip}

CLIP \cite{vl_clip} is a multi-modal learning framework that utilizes contrastive learning to align images and text within a shared embedding space. It is designed to acquire representations that generalize well across different tasks without the need for task-specific fine-tuning. By training on extensive datasets of image-text pairs, CLIP learns to capture meaningful associations between visual and textual modalities.

\subsection{CLIP Architecture}
\label{subsec:clip_architecture}

\subsubsection{CLIP Components}
CLIP comprises two principal components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Image Encoder}: Responsible for processing images and extracting feature representations. This typically involves a Swin Transformer, pooling layers, and additional modules to capture spatial hierarchies and relationships within image data.
    \item \textbf{Text Encoder}: Processes textual data and converts it into a format suitable for comparison with image features. It generally includes transformer layers and attention mechanisms to capture semantic relationships within the text.
\end{itemize}

CLIP is trained using a contrastive loss function that aligns image and text features in a shared embedding space. This enables the model to learn representations applicable to a variety of tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. In the context of this work, CLIP's capabilities are leveraged for weakly supervised semantic segmentation, which relies solely on image-level classification.

\subsection{Unified Contrastive Learning (UniCL)}
\label{subsec:unicl}

UniCL, or Unified Contrastive Learning \cite{vl_unicl}, is a multi-modal learning framework that extends the ideas of CLIP by unifying different contrastive learning strategies within a single architecture. This enables more effective and flexible learning from multiple modalities.

UniCL is more than a straightforward extension of CLIP; it introduces several important innovations to improve both performance and adaptability.

A key feature of UniCL is its unified approach to contrastive learning, integrating image-label and text-label associations into a joint image-label-text space. This unified framework allows the model to leverage more positive pairs during training. While CLIP treats only the provided image-text pair as a positive match, UniCL recognizes that multiple text descriptions or images can correspond to the same category. For instance, both "a photo of a cat" and "a photo of a kitten" may be valid positive pairs for an image of a cat. UniCLâ€™s contrastive loss encourages the model to learn similarities across all features sharing the same category, resulting in a more comprehensive and robust shared representation space for images and text.

\subsubsection{Unified Image-Text-Label Contrast in UniCL}
\label{subsec:unified_image_text_label_contrast}

UniCL employs a bidirectional learning objective between image-text pairs:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:unified_image_text_label_contrast}
    \min_{\{\theta, \phi\}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{BiC}} = \mathcal{L}_{i2t} + \mathcal{L}_{t2i},
\end{equation}
where \(\mathcal{L}_{i2t}\) and \(\mathcal{L}_{t2i}\) are the image-to-text and text-to-image contrastive losses, respectively. And \(\theta\) and \(\phi\) are the parameters of the image and text encoders, respectively.

The image-to-text contrastive loss to align matched images in a batch with a given text is defined as:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:unicl_image_to_text_contrastive_loss}
    \mathcal{L}_{i2t} = - \sum_{i \in \mathcal{B}} \frac{1}{|\mathcal{P}(i)|} \sum_{k \in \mathcal{P}(i)} 
    \log \frac{\exp(\tau \mathbf{u}_i^\top \mathbf{v}_k)}{\sum_{j \in \mathcal{B}} \exp(\tau \mathbf{u}_i^\top \mathbf{v}_j)},
\end{equation}
where $k \in \mathcal{P}(i) = \{k | k \in \mathcal{B}, y_k = y_i\}$, i.e., the set of all images in the batch that belong to the same class as image $i$.

On the other hand, the text-to-image contrastive loss to align matched text in a batch with a given image is defined as:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:unicl_text_to_image_contrastive_loss}
    \mathcal{L}_{t2i} = - \sum_{j \in \mathcal{B}} \frac{1}{|\mathcal{P}(j)|} \sum_{k \in \mathcal{P}(j)} 
    \log \frac{\exp(\tau \mathbf{u}_k^\top \mathbf{v}_j)}{\sum_{i \in \mathcal{B}} \exp(\tau \mathbf{u}_i^\top \mathbf{v}_j)},
\end{equation}
where $k \in \mathcal{P}(j) = \{k \mid k \in \mathcal{B}, y_k = y_j\}$, i.e., the set of all text features in the batch that belong to the same class as text $j$.

\subsubsection{Comparison with CLIP}
\label{subsec:clip_vs_unicl}

In case CLIP, for an image, there is only one positive text feature. In other words, $\mathcal{P}(i) = {i} \in \mathcal{B}$; and $\mathcal{P}(j) = {j} \in \mathcal{B}$. So, the image-to-text contrastive loss is defined as:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:clip_image_to_text_contrastive_loss}
    \mathcal{L}_{i2t} = - \sum_{i \in \mathcal{B}} 
    \log \frac{\exp(\tau \mathbf{u}_i^\top \mathbf{v}_i)}{\sum_{j \in \mathcal{B}} \exp(\tau \mathbf{u}_i^\top \mathbf{v}_j)},
\end{equation}
where $i \in \mathcal{B}$ is the index of the image in the batch.

And the text-to-image contrastive loss is defined as:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:clip_text_to_image_contrastive_loss}
    \mathcal{L}_{t2i} = - \sum_{j \in \mathcal{B}} 
    \log \frac{\exp(\tau \mathbf{u}_j^\top \mathbf{v}_j)}{\sum_{i \in \mathcal{B}} \exp(\tau \mathbf{u}_i^\top \mathbf{v}_j)},
\end{equation}
where $j \in \mathcal{B}$ is the index of the text feature in the batch. 

The equations \ref{eq:unified_image_text_label_contrast}-\ref{eq:clip_text_to_image_contrastive_loss} are taken from \cite{vl_unicl}.

This means that $\mathcal{L}_{BiC}$ becomes CLIP training objective. The main property in \autoref{eq:unicl_text_to_image_contrastive_loss} is that for each image feature, any of the text features in the batch can be used as a positive pair. And so is the case for \autoref{eq:unicl_text_to_image_contrastive_loss}.

Second, UniCL replaces CLIP's ViT backbone with a Swin Transformer backbone. The Swin Transformer is a hierarchical vision transformer that captures both local and global information in images, making it more suitable for various vision tasks.

\subsection{Swin Transformer}
\label{subsec:swin_transformer}
Swin Transformer is a hierarchical vision transformer that employs a shifted windowing scheme to capture both local and global information in images. It is designed to be computationally efficient while maintaining high performance on various vision tasks. The architecture consists of multiple stages, each with its own set of transformer blocks, allowing it to process images at different resolutions and capture multi-scale features.

\autoref{fig:swin_vs_vit_architecture} illustrates the architectures of the Swin Transformer and Vision Transformers (ViT). The key distinction lies in their processing strategies: the Swin Transformer employs a hierarchical structure, processing feature maps at multiple resolutions, while ViT processes the entire image globally at a single resolution. This hierarchical approach enables the Swin Transformer to effectively capture both local and global information, making it particularly suitable for tasks requiring fine-grained details alongside overall context.

The Swin Transformer builds hierarchical feature maps by progressively merging image patches (depicted in gray) in deeper layers. It computes self-attention only within local windows (highlighted in red), resulting in linear computational complexity relative to the input image size. This efficiency, combined with its ability to handle dense recognition tasks, makes it a versatile backbone for both image classification and segmentation.

In contrast, traditional vision Transformers, such as ViT, produce feature maps at a single low resolution and compute self-attention globally, leading to quadratic computational complexity with respect to the input image size. This global attention mechanism, while effective for certain tasks, is less efficient for dense prediction tasks compared to the Swin Transformer's localized attention mechanism.

            \hfill
            \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}

        \end{minipage}
    }
    \caption{Comparison of Swin Transformer and ViT Architectures}
    \label{fig:swin_vs_vit_architecture}
\end{figure}

Because of the hierarchical nature of the Swin Transformer, it is particularly well-suited for tasks that require a combination of global context (to indentify the overall structure of the image) and local details (to capture fine-grained features, e.g., edges, textures). This makes it a strong candidate for image segmentation tasks.

Also, the Contrastive and Multi-Modal Learning capabilities of UniCL can be effectively combined with the Swin Transformer's hierarchical architecture to enhance the model's ability to learn rich and discriminative features from both image and text modalities. This combination allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the data, leading to improved performance.

Now, getting all the background information, we can proceed to the proposed methodology. The proposed methodology consists of several key components, including the backbone architecture, CAM generation, pseudo label generation, segmentation prediction, and refinement. Each component plays a crucial role in enhancing the overall performance of the model.
